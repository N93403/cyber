# Heartbleed Exploit Analysis

## Vulnerability Overview
- **CVE**: CVE-2014-0160
- **Type**: Buffer over-read
- **Impact**: Information disclosure
- **CVSS Score**: 7.5 (High)

## Technical Analysis

### The Bug
```c
// Vulnerable code in OpenSSL
unsigned int payload;
n2s(p, payload); // Read length from client without validation
memcpy(bp, pl, payload); // Copy without bounds checking

Exploit Mechanism
Client Hello: Establish TLS connection

Malicious Heartbeat: Send small payload with large length declaration

Server Response: Returns declared length from its memory

Data Extraction: Parse leaked memory for sensitive information

Exploit Code Breakdown
Key Components
TLS Handshake: Manual Client Hello implementation

Heartbeat Request: Crafted with length mismatch

Memory Reading: Extracts 64KB of server memory

Data Parsing: Searches for credentials and keys

Impact Assessment
What Can Be Leaked
Private SSL keys

User credentials

Session cookies

Application data

System information

Real-world Impact
Compromise of encryption

Session hijacking

Data theft

System compromise

Detection & Mitigation
Detection
bash
# Test for vulnerability
openssl s_client -connect target:443 -tlsextdebug 2>&1 | grep "heartbeat"

# Use scanning tools
nmap -p 443 --script ssl-heartbleed target
Mitigation
Update OpenSSL to patched version

Reissue SSL certificates

Rotate all credentials

Monitor for suspicious activity

Ethical Considerations
Use only for educational purposes

Test only on owned systems

Practice responsible disclosure

Follow legal guidelines
